#  __DVB-S2 Stream Analysis and Processing Application__
##  __Overview__
This project is dedicated to the development of a software application for the analysis and processing of DVB-S2 receiver output streams, including raw BB Frames, GSE, and TS in near real-time. The software is capable of classifying and identifying various types of data and protocols, detecting encryption or scrambling, and extracting useful content such as VoIP calls, audio/video programs, files, emails, and web pages.
## __Features__
1. __Classification & Identification__
   Audio, video, data, and protocols such as MPE, ULE, SIP, RTP, FTP, SFTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SNMP, POP, SMTP, SSH, etc.
2. __Encryption/Scrambling Detection:__
   Identify encryption or scrambling techniques through headers and SI tables.
3. __Content Extraction:__
   Extract VoIP calls, audio and video programs, files, emails, web pages, etc., into separate files.
4. __Content Decoding and Playback:__
Decode and play selected audio/video content.
